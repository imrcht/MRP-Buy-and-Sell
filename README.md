# MRP-Buy-and-Sell
Project created by Muneeb, Rachit and Priyesh

The main aim of project was to design a simple and secure website for customers so that they easily buy and sell used products at cheaper price. We have used Nodejs and MongoDB for back-end and database work, JWT(Jason Web Token) to make the application secure, HTML/EJS , CSS to make the front-end part sweet and simple.
